	<p>  We are High School students, at a school in Southern California. We have been asked to find a solvable problem for our Project Lead The Way engineering course. As students we are constantly annoyed with standing in lines at the cafeteria, library, and office. We took this problem and decided that making an app to organize the school would be extremely helpful, not only for the students, but for the staff members as well.
