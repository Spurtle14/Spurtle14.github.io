	<p>  We are High School students, at a school in Southern California. We have been asked to find a solvable problem for our Project Lead The Way engineering course. As students we are constantly annoyed with standing in lines at the cafeteria, library, and office. We took this problem and decided that making an app to organize the school would be extremely helpful, not only for the students, but for the staff members as well. 
Problem At El Segundo High School, as well as other schools, the long and tedious lines discourage students and make going to school exhausting. The lines in the cafeteria, office, and library have caused students to be tardy to class and made a negative learning environment. Something can be done about this problem. 
Solution Make an app that can organize the school 
Cafeteria: Allow students to order lunch from their smart phones making the lines shorter and wasting less time. 
Library.: Allow students to check out books on the app and have inventory on the books that have been checked out. 
Counselors: Allow students to add their appointments onto the counselors' calendars. This gives students and counselors the ability to communicate with each other more clearly instead of waiting in line for their turn.
